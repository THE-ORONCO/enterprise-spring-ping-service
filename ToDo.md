# ToDo

- abstract integration flows into interfaces and put them into a separate package
- put the actual implementation of the flows into a separate project that is a wrapper around the main executable so
  that the concrete definitions can be customer specific
- find a way to visualize integration flow
- use [gateway interfaces](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/gateway.html) to abstract out the outflow of messages


- find out if Spring Cloud Data Flow does something similar or what it is used for instead
